// A `JsonRpcTransport` over the Rust-supervised ACP child (#14).
//
// `AcpRuntime` takes a line channel and never spawns anything — the webview has
// no `child_process`. Rust owns the process (`src-tauri/src/acp.rs`) and relays
// its stdout as `acp:line` events; this adapter is the other end of that pipe.
//
// Deliberately NOT available in the gateway web client: the agent would have to
// run on the phone, which has no such process. `isTauri` gates it, and Settings
// hides the picker in web mode rather than offering a control that cannot work
// (AGENTS.md).
